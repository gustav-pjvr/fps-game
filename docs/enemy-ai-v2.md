# Enemy AI v2 | Squad tactics

The living design and build record for the solo-play enemy AI upgrade, started 2026-09-15 on the
branch `feature/enemy-ai`. It is updated as each task lands, so at any point it says what the new
system is, why it is shaped that way, what has been built, and what has been measured. The history
of the original AI (patrol, line of sight, ranged combat, melee, archetypes) is in
[enemy-ai.md](enemy-ai.md).

## Goal

Make the single-player enemies read as a squad instead of a set of individual bots. Today each
enemy only knows what it saw itself, stands still while fighting, walks to one spot when it loses
the player, gives no cue about what it is doing, and nothing paces a fight. The target is enemies
that share what they know, take roles (someone pins, someone flanks), use cover, search properly,
say what they are doing, and (in a new opt-in mode) arrive in paced waves.

Multiplayer is untouched: these enemies only exist in single-player, and nothing here changes the
network protocol.

## Research basis

Full report: <https://claude.ai/artifact/S45Eg6v4AcmBZNTgLGLADu> (2026-09-15). The short version:

- **The Last of Us (Naughty Dog):** a sight timer instead of instant detection, a view angle that
  narrows with distance, one shared "last known position", a Combat Coordinator that hands out
  roles (Flanker, Approacher, Investigator, Shooter), position picking by multiplying 0 to 1 scores
  over sampled points with a fixed raycast budget (160 a frame on PS3), and a search grid whose
  probability spreads outward and clears wherever an enemy can see.
- **F.E.A.R. (Monolith):** its famous squad tactics were simple squad behaviours (get to cover,
  advance with a suppressor, search in pairs) plus dialogue that announced them. The planner was
  not what made them look smart.
- **DOOM 2016 (id):** attack tokens per attack type, stealing a token from a worse-placed ally, and
  token count as a difficulty dial.
- **Killzone (Guerrilla):** position picking scored on cover from threats, line of fire, distance
  and travel cost.
- **Left 4 Dead (Valve):** an intensity-driven director (build up, peak, fade, relax) that spawns
  out of sight.
- **Halo (Bungie):** predictable beats random; players reward AI they can read.

What was deliberately ruled out: a GOAP planner, machine-learning bots, and LLM-driven enemies.

## Plan and status

Status key: done, in progress, next, later, conditional.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Research: re-read the enemy code and the world APIs position picking needs | done |
| 2 | Research: measure raycast cost | folded into task 3 (see decisions) |
| 3 | Once-a-second perf logger, plus a runnable perf spec | built and unit-tested; baseline run in progress |
| 4 | Design: architecture pass by a Fable subagent | in progress |
| 5 | Branch `feature/enemy-ai` | done |
| 6 to 9 | Step 1: squad knowledge, awareness meter, event routing, tests (checkpoint A) | later |
| 10 to 12 | Step 2: combat coordinator and roles (checkpoint B) | later |
| 13 to 17 | Step 3: position picking, ray budget, combat skills (checkpoint C) | later |
| 18 to 19 | Step 4: search grid and paired sweeps | later |
| 20 to 22 | Step 5: callouts, telegraph, stagger (checkpoint D) | later |
| 23 to 25 | Step 6: pacing director as a new opt-in solo mode (checkpoint E) | later |
| 26 to 27 | Step 7: navmesh with recast-navigation-js | conditional on checkpoint C |
| 28 to 30 | Final review, docs and version, merge and deploy | later |

## Decisions

- **2026-09-15, Gustav:** task 3 changed from "Gustav records a manual F3 baseline" to "build a
  logger that prints FPS and other stats every second, which Claude can run itself".
- **2026-09-15:** task 2 (a separate Node raycast benchmark) was folded into the logger. The
  logger measures raycasts per second and AI milliseconds per tick inside the real game world,
  with real terrain, houses and trees, which is a better number than a synthetic scene would give.
- **2026-09-15, defaults taken while Gustav approved the plan without answering the three open
  questions:** stop at each checkpoint (A to E) for a playtest on the branch preview; Fable
  designs (task 4) and reviews (task 28) while implementation happens on the main thread; the
  pacing director is a separate new solo mode, not a replacement for the current practice setup.
  Any of these can be reopened.
- **2026-09-15, Gustav:** no stopping at checkpoints. Work continues straight through, but each
  checkpoint (A to E) ends with a full test pass (typecheck, unit suite, smoke suite, a perf log
  run compared against the baseline, and a targeted behaviour check) and a documentation update
  here before the next step starts.

## Measurement tooling

`src/core/perfStats.ts` records one row per second during a match:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `fps`, `frameMsAvg/P95/Max` | Real frames drawn in that second and their timing. Needs a real GPU. |
| `ticks` | Fixed-step updates run (60 when the game keeps up). |
| `physicsMs`, `worldMs`, `aiMs` | Average milliseconds per tick in the Rapier step, world chunk streaming, and `EntityManager.update` (all enemy and target logic). CPU work, so comparable even in the sandbox. |
| `aiMsMax` | The worst single tick's AI time, to catch spikes. |
| `renderMs` | CPU time submitting each frame to WebGL. Needs a real GPU to mean much. |
| `raycastsPerSec` | Every `castHitscan` call: enemy line of sight, shots, whiskers, and player shots. |
| `enemies`, `states` | Live enemies and how many are in each AI state. |
| `drawCalls`, `triangles`, `heapMb` | Renderer and memory context (heap is Chrome-only). |

Ways to use it:

- **Playing normally:** open the game with `?perflog` on the end of the URL (for example
  `http://localhost:5173/?perflog`), or press **F4** during a match. A line prints to the browser
  console every second. F4 again stops printing.
- **Scripted:** `npx playwright test e2e/perf-log.spec.ts` runs a baseline at spawn and then a
  sustained fight, and prints a summary of both. Add `--headed` on a real GPU for frame rates.
  `PERF_ENEMIES` and `PERF_SECONDS` override the enemy count (default 20) and fight length
  (default 30 s).
- **From the console:** `__gameDebug.getPerfLog()` returns every row recorded so far.

## Measurements

Filled in as runs happen. Sandbox rows are CPU-only (SwiftShader, see PERFORMANCE.md): the
sandbox draws 2 to 4 frames a second, so the fixed-step loop hits its 0.25 s frame cap and runs
45 to 60 ticks a second instead of 60. Per-tick milliseconds are the figures to compare.

### Baseline, before any v2 code (2026-09-15, sandbox, 20 enemies, 0 targets)

| Phase | AI ms/tick (worst tick) | Physics ms/tick | World ms/tick | Raycasts/s | Enemies alerted or chasing |
|-------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Standing at spawn, 10 s | 0.32 (4.50, first frames) | 1.20 | 0.02 | 2,240 | 1.0 |
| Fight v1, 30 s | 0.26 (1.50) | 1.22 | 0.01 | 3,288 | 0.3 |
| Fight v2, 30 s (the reference for later checkpoints) | 0.26 (4.10) | 1.22 | 0.01 | 2,895 | 5.4 |

Fight v2 is the scenario the checkpoints compare against: every 3 s the player steps 8 m from
the nearest idle enemy and fires into the air, so the fight grows to 4 to 7 chasing enemies.
Five chasers cost no more AI time per tick than twenty patrollers, because a chaser that stands
and fires stops casting whisker rays.

What it shows:

- Patrol dominates the raycast count. At 20 enemies, 3 whisker rays per moving enemy per tick
  is 3,600 a second at 60 ticks, which matches the 3,000 to 3,800 a second measured once the loop
  runs near full rate. Line of sight (one ray per enemy every 0.15 s) is only about 130 a second.
- AI is cheap: about a quarter of a millisecond per tick for 20 enemies, one fifth of physics.
  The v2 budget has real room, but raycasts are the thing to watch.
- The first fight scenario engaged almost nobody (0.3 enemies alerted or chasing on average):
  firing into the air from one spot only pulled a few enemies into a short search. The spec was
  reworked to keep moving the player next to fresh enemies, and re-baselined below.
